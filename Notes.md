# Notes

Unfortunately after some time of development the project has become something more and more difficult, at the same time that I have to develop the client side I also worry about the server side, this ended up wearing me out along with other problems that I had already been facing.

## As learning
I can say that Organize was the biggest project I have ever developed, I had incredible experiences and I could see in several aspects what I can improve in code, being the structure and usability of components react, readability, performance, etc.
